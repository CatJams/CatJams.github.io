## Overview

Team Catjams have been working on a project for HACC 2021, specifically, a chatbot for The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA). The purpose of this chatbot is to reduce the number of calls OHA receives for information and applications. By providing an easy to access medium through which these questions can be answered, there will be less total calls to OHA, reducing the amount of resources needed.

## Community Feedback

### Morresh
* Thinks the website looks nice and the chatbot does what it needs to do
* Found a question that the chatbot responds to in weird ways
* Send feedback page has a lot of empty space. Maybe add something to it

### Dylan
* Likes that the chatbot gives links and options when asked certain questions
* The website does what it sets out to do
* Add a darkmode or slightly darker colors to the pages
* Make the footer sticky to the bottom of the page
* Make the images on the tutorial page slightly bigger. Hard to read on large screens

### Evelien
* Would like a description of what the website/catbot is for!
* Homepage and Admin pages are nicely done
* Tutorial page uses words Catbot and Chatbot interchangeably. Stick to one of the other to make it less confusing
* Chatbot gives funny responses. Limited in recognizing input, but gives good answers for the questions it can recognize

### Andreas
* The site looks great and is easily accessible, exactly what you're looking for on a chat bot side
* Chatbot is friendly and has accurate links and information
* Everything is easy to find and in a logical location
* The chatbot has a few weird responses to certain questions

### Jacob
* Website looks nice and everything works well
* The chatbot gives good responses. Likes that the chatbot can detect questions that are written in an odd way as well
* Footer should be attached to the bottom of the page. It looks weird on smaller pages.
