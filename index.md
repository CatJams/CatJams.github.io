# overview

Team Catjams have been working on a project for HACC 2021, specifically, a chatbot for The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA). The purpose of this chatbot is to reduce the number of calls OHA receives for information and applications. By providing an easy to access medium through which these questions can be answered, there will be less total calls to OHA, reducing the amount of resources needed.
